Dear Sir or Madam,\\[.5em]

I am writing in reference to the position of Research Scientist in the field of 
Web of Things. I have the pleasure of being acquainted with one of the 
researchers of your staff, Dr. Darko Anicic. I have being working with him as 
my supervisor recently as a Working Student at Siemens for the past 6 
months. He let me know about the position and encouraged me to apply.

My early working experience as a System Administrator for the Informatics 
Faculty back in my home country brought me a strong technical knowledge about 
Operative Systems and Computer Architecture. In particular, I had the 
opportunity to manipulate and program in different architectures like x86, 
SPARC and even Alpha processors. They all taught me about the connection 
between higher level applications to the underlying metal. With a strong 
background in the C programming language, I have found again this familiar 
environment in my current projects when working with constrained devices.

After my Bachelor's, I worked for a year in a start-up in the development of 
Web technologies. The experience brought me a good understanding on the web 
infrastructure. The same one from which many protocols, APIs and semantics are 
directly adapted for thing interactions in the highly fragmented IoT landscape. 
For example, working with the CoAP protocol was interesting for understanding 
the adjustments made to emulate the functionality of the complex HTTP inside a 
constrained environment.

In the Technical University of Munich, I found an extraordinary level of 
education. There I participate actively in the Computer Vision research group,
where I wrote my Master thesis and also collaborated in different research 
projects. In addition of improving my formation, that experience gave me 
a good insight on how to do academical research.

To the end of my Master's studies, I started working with Dr. Anicic as a 
Working Student. The opportunity to work together with an expert in a 
groundbreaking company as Siemens was simply extraordinary. I find a huge 
potential in his research in addition to very interesting challenges and 
problems. I have a great motivation to try new ideas and possibly apply my 
knowledge on Machine Learning, for example, to create more intelligent and 
complex interactions. As a direct consequence, Dr.  Anicic was satisfied with 
my performance and encouraged me to continue working in this area.

Please take the time to consider my attached resume. I would greatly appreciate 
the opportunity to personally discuss what I have to bring to the position.

Yours sincerely,\\[1em] % if the opening is "Dear Sir or Madam,"
