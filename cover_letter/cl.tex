Dear Sir or Madam,\\[.5em]

I am writing in reference to the position of Research Scientist in the field of 
Web of Things at the Internet of Things group. I have the pleasure of being 
acquainted with one of the researchers of your staff, Dr. Darko Anicic. I have 
being working with him as my supervisor in my recent job as Working Student at 
Siemens for the past 6 months. He let me know about the position and encouraged
me to apply.

I have a diverse experience in areas related to Computer Engineering and 
Research. My early working experience as a System Administrator for the 
Informatics Faculty back in my home country brought me invaluable knowledge 
that would turn useful when working in the Web of Things field. In particular,
I had the opportunity to manipulate and program for different processor
architectures. From the common x86, going through the SPARC to even 
Alpha processors. They all taught me about the connection between higher level 
applications to the underlying metal. Without knowing it, this proved 
itself useful when I worked with smaller processors used in applications for
the Internet of Things.

After finishing my Bachelor studies, I decided to continue my studies in 
Germany, as I am interested in learning the language. In the Technical 
University of Munich, I found an extraordinary level of education. That 
motivated me to actively participate in the Computer Vision research group.  
There I wrote my Master thesis and also collaborated in different research 
projects. Besides improving my technical skills, that experience gave me a good 
insight on how to do academical research. In particular, how to write proper 
scientific articles of good quality.

To the end of my Master's studies, I started working with Dr. Anicic as a 
Working Student. My main motivation was the curiosity on the field of the 
Internet of Things, as I was interested to know about its potential. The 
opportunity to work together with an expert in a groundbreaking company as Siemens was 
simply extraordinary. I found that it is not just an interesting field but that
I also enjoy its challenges and related problems. As a direct 
consequence, Dr. Anicic was satisfied with my performance and encouraged me to 
continue.

Please take the time to consider my attached resume. I would greatly appreciate 
the opportunity to personally discuss what I have to bring to the position.

Yours sincerely,\\[1em] % if the opening is "Dear Sir or Madam,"
